boilerplate
===========

This is a starting point for my projects. Boilerplate code for different scenarios is in different branches.

This boilerplate is MIT-licensed, as well as the projects it’s used for. So feel free to use it if you want.


Usage
-----

1) Clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tomekwi/boilerplate <my project name>
```


2) Bootstrap:

```sh
$ git checkout <boilerplate flavor – I normally go for `javascript`>
$ ./_boilerplate.fish <name> <description> [<title> [<repo>]]
```
